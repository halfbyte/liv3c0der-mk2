## State

Does nothing useful right now. Please go away and come back later :)

## Ideas

(this is currently a scratchpad for ideas of what I want to implement)

- arp helper
  - arp(note, chord, mode, callback)

- beat helper
  - modbeat(mod, eq, callback, params)
  - drum('*--*--*--*', callback, params)

### Channel system

A fixed set of preconfigured channels:

- [0] Basedrum with configurable compression and distortion
- [1] Snare channel with configurable delay and reverb and probably some EQing
- [2] Generic percussion channel
- [4] Bass channel with configurable distortion
- [5-8] a couple of generic channels with adjustable sends only

2-3 Send channels:

- Reverb/Delay and a configurable Reverb>Delay as send channels, adjustable per channel
